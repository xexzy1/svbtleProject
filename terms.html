          </li>
          <li>

              </ol>
              <p>This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by Svbtle at any time.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Changes.</strong></p>
            <p>Svbtle reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace any part of this Agreement. It is your responsibility to check this Agreement periodically for changes.

          </li>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have a paid Svbtle account, such account can only be terminated by Svbtle if you materially breach this Agreement and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days from Svbtle’s notice to you thereof; provided that, Svbtle can terminate the Services immediately as part of a general shut down of our service.

Svbtle shall have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond their reasonable control. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>General Representation and Warranty.</strong></p>
            <p>You represent and warrant that (i) your use of the Services will be in strict accordance with the Svbtle Privacy Policy, with this Agreement and with all applicable laws and regulations (including without limitation any local laws or regulations in your country, state, city, or other governmental area, regarding online conduct and acceptable content, and including all applicable laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the USA or the country in which you reside) and (ii) your use of the Services will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of any third party.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Indemnification.</strong></p>
            <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Svbtle, its contractors, and its licensors, and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all claims and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Services, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Miscellaneous.</strong></p>
            <p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Svbtle and you concerning the subject matter hereof, and they may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of Svbtle, or by the posting by Svbtle of a revised version. Except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise, this Agreement, any access to or use of the Services will be governed by the laws of the USA, excluding its conflict of law provisions, and the proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to any of the same will be the state and federal courts located in the USA. Except for claims for injunctive or equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property rights (which may be brought in any competent court without the posting of a bond), any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be finally settled in accordance with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. (“JAMS”) by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with such Rules. The arbitration shall take place in the USA, in the English language and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees. If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. You may assign your rights under this Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to be bound by, its terms and conditions; Svbtle may assign its rights under this Agreement without condition. This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>
